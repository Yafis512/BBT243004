This C++ program multiplies two numbers entered by the user and displays the result. After calculating the product, the program checks if the product is less than 10 or not:

1. The user is prompted to input two values: pow1 and pow2.
2. The program multiplies pow1 and pow2 and stores the result in product.
3. It then prints the product.
4. If the product is less than 10, it prints "bad". Otherwise, it prints "good".
