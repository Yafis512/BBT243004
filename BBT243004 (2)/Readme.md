This Python program calculates the product of numbers in two separate loops:

In the first loop, it multiplies the variable product (starting at 2) by each number from 1 to 4.
In the second loop, it continues multiplying the result from the first loop by each number from 1 to 5.
Finally, the program prints the final value of product after both loops are completed.
