Python Program This Python program takes two integer inputs from the user, adds them together, and displays the result. Based on the sum of the two numbers, the program will print a message:
1. If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, it will print "good".
2. If the sum is between 8 and 9 (inclusive), it will print "bad".
3. If the sum is less than 8, it will print "fail".
